    "Here we are demonstrating a new functionality within [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/), which can parse and make use of information stored in the filenames of a given dataset. This notebook demonstrates the functionality from the point of view of the end-user/data-scientist: you get the information you want, based on a spec in a catalog file (more on how to create these is in [this example](csv.ipynb)). No more writing messy loops and parsing code to extract the information yourself. Link to the [blog post](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/intake-parsing-data-from-filenames-and-paths/).\n",

Landsat data consists of multiple georeferenced images of the an area at a given time. These images are stored as separate files with each file representing a different frequency. For this NDVI calculation we'll need Band 4 (Red) and Band 5 (Near Infrared)."
